I am a fourth year PhD student at the National University of Singapore under A-STAR SINGA programme. I am co-advised by [Dr. Nancy Chen](https://sites.google.com/site/nancyfchen/home?pli=1) from A-STAR / I2R and [Prof. Min-Yen Kan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy/) from NUS / SoC.

I am interested in working with text data, especially the conversational ones. Specifically, I am working on domain-adaptation for task-oriented dialogues in the low data scheme (few/zero-shot). Previously I got my bachelor's in Bilkent University in Computer Science and also worked part-time for a year in Milsoft as a software engineer. 

Apart from my academic studies, I like to read sci-fi/fantasy novels and birdwatching. I also like to play board games (Battle Line, Catan, The Resistance are among my favorites).
