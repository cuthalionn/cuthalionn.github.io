I work as a research scientist in Salesforce AI Research Singapore. My main focus is on training time series foundation models for forecasting. I also work on applied problems concerning reasoning over time series data, where I try to bridge the gap between language and time series modalities.  

I earned my PhD at the National University of Singapore under A-STAR SINGA programme. I was co-advised by [Dr. Nancy Chen](https://sites.google.com/site/nancyfchen/home?pli=1) from A-STAR / I2R and [Prof. Min-Yen Kan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy/) from NUS / SoC. During my PhD I worked with text data, especially the conversational ones. Specifically, my work focused on domain-adaptation for task-oriented dialogues in the low data scheme (few/zero-shot). Before PhD I got my bachelor's in Bilkent University in Computer Science and also worked part-time for a year in Milsoft as a software engineer. 

I like to read sci-fi/fantasy novels and birdwatching. I also like to play board games (Battle Line, Catan, The Resistance are among my favorites).
